# StudyBuddy
## Study smarter, together!

Have you ever thought: Man, it sure would be nice if I could discuss that difficult topic from lecture 5 with someone! Well now you can use StudyBuddy to organise study sessions with like-minded peers!

This is an ongoing project developed by Angus Wong initially for IFN666 Web and Mobile Application Development at the Queensland University of Technology.

Currently, only the backend API has been completed. The frontend REACT application will undergo development soon.
